## ðŸ”¢ Current Topic: GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

### Euclidâ€™s Algorithm
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to compute the GCD of two integers.

- **Iterative Version** â†’ `gcd/euclid_iterative.py`  
- **Recursive Version** â†’ `gcd/euclid_recursive.py`  

### Example
```bash
python gcd/euclid_iterative.py
# Output: 5

python gcd/euclid_recursive.py
# Output: 5
```

## Goals 
- Provide simple teaching examples for core algorithms.
- Project will expand over time as I add to it.
